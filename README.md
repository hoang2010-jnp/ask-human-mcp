## Overview

**ask-human mcp** is designed to improve AI interactions by providing a mechanism for the AI to ask for clarification instead of making unfounded assumptions. This tool acts as a mentor for AI, guiding it to avoid hallucinations and false confidence.

## The Pain

AI systems often generate incorrect or non-existent information. This leads to:

- **Misleading Outputs**: The AI may provide endpoints or data that do not exist.
- **False Confidence**: The agent assumes it is correct, causing unnecessary debugging time.
- **Wasted Time**: Repeating errors can consume valuable time that could be spent on productive tasks.

## The Fix

The **ask-human mcp** server allows the AI to "raise its hand" when it encounters uncertainty. This approach fosters a more interactive and accurate AI experience. Instead of blindly continuing, the AI seeks guidance, similar to how a diligent intern would.

## Features

- **Error Reduction**: By encouraging the AI to ask questions, it minimizes errors in outputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to set up and integrate into existing AI systems.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for anyone to use and contribute.
